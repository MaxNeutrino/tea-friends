  I realy like tea, ohter people also like it. 
  The social network is for people who love tea. 
  It is called Tea-Friends. It allows the user to have a list of drinking tea and a tea wishlist, 
  browse the list of existing kinds of tea, comment and so on. 
  Of course, the main thing is to give people an opportunity to discuss themes about tea.

  I used popular tools and Java technologies: Maven, Spring MVC, JPA (Hibernate), MDL (css, js), PostgreSQL, 
  jQuery, Java 8 Stream.
  
  The project is at the development stage.
